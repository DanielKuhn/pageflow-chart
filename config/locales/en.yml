          text: ! "# Chart\n\nIntegration of a Datawrapper-Diagram\n\nHere you can add animated infographics to your Pageflow. The diagram is embedded into a background-picture and text. To enlarge the graphic you simply have to click on it. \n\nBut first of all you have to create your graphic externally and generate a link. You can find examples and requirements for this under www.datawrapper.de.\n\nNote that Datawrapper offers a special layout option for charts that shall be embedded into a Pageflow: In the \"Visualize\" step of the chart creation wizard, click the \"Design\" tab and select the \"Pageflow\" layout. That way a color scheme is used which complements Pageflow's look.\n\nExamples of application: statistics, diagrams, numbers & facts"
